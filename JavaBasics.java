        // There are abstract classes and abstract methods. interfaces which along with abstract classes can not be
        // instanciated. concrete classes which is the first class that extends an abstract class and defines abstract
        // methods. abstract methods prior to defining them are nothing more than a method signature such as
        // boolean testMethod(int arg) or void setMethod(String arg). Everything in this document will be explained
